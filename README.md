# java-calculator
This is a calculator that utilizes the Javaluator library, which you can find at https://javaluator.sourceforge.net/en/home/.   
I need to address the issue where large integers do not appear correctly on the screen or cause the screen to scroll. Additionally, I plan to enhance the overall styling and introduce new functions.
